### Building
- Get [Boost](http://www.boost.org/).
- Create a build directory along the *src* directory.
- Run `cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=path/to/boost/base/dir ..` from the build directory (or you can use **cmake-gui** if you're on Windows).
- Run `make` or compile the **ALL_BUILD** project from the generated VS solution.
